Two separate analyses were performed on two datasets. The first dataset contained the profits/losses for a business and the second dataset contained ballot information for a rural town. 

The .csv files were read into python and the columns to be analyzed were converted to lists using a "for" loop.

The results of the analyses were printed to the terminal and also written to a .txt file that can be found in the "Analysis" folders.

Help for these scripts were obtained from the following sources:
